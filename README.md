## How to Build
  Create a Makefile and another file for the main program to be housed in. There is a method called "boomersooner" that reads the input
  and stores an integer into a variable that then runs conditional statements to figure out if the modulus is either 3 and/or 5. If it is 3
  it will output "Boomer!", if it is 5 it will output "Sooner!" and if it is both 3 and 5 it will output "Boomer Sooner!". The program
  will end if there are no more integers and output "not an integer, goodbye!" 

## How to Run 
  Simply upload a file of integers as the input and gcc a0.c in order to run the program

##Bugs and assmuptions
